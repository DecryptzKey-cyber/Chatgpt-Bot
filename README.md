   ```
2. **PNPM**: We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage dependencies. If you have never installed pnpm, you can install it with the following command:
   ```bash
    npm i -g pnpm
   ```
3. **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Before running this application, you need to obtain the API key from OpenAI. You can register the API key at [https://beta.openai.com/signup](https://beta.openai.com/signup).

### Getting Started
